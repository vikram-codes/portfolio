# Personal Portfolio

A modern, responsive portfolio website built to showcase my journey as a developer and share the projects I've been working on.

## About This Project

This portfolio represents my exploration into modern web development. As a student actively seeking internship opportunities, I wanted to create something that reflects both my technical skills and my personality. It's not meant to be flashy or over-the-top, just an honest representation of where I am in my coding journey.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Projects Section**: A collection of applications I've built while learning different technologies
- **About Me**: A bit about my background, interests, and what drives me to code
- **Skills & Tools**: The technologies I'm comfortable with and the ones I'm currently exploring
- **Contact**: Ways to reach out if you'd like to connect

## Built With

- **Next.js 14** - React framework for production
- **TypeScript** - For better code reliability and developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS** - For responsive design and styling
- **Framer Motion** - Adding smooth animations and interactions

## Easter Eggs ü•ö‚ú®

I couldn't resist adding some hidden surprises that reflect my humorous personality! Here's what you can discover:

### üéÆ The Konami Code

Remember the classic cheat code? Try entering **‚Üë ‚Üë ‚Üì ‚Üì ‚Üê ‚Üí ‚Üê ‚Üí B A** on your keyboard. I've hidden some pretty unhinged developer commentary that gets progressively more chaotic with each use. Fair warning: my sense of humor is... questionable.

### üê± The Cat Reveal

Hover over my profile emoji in the hero section and watch a judgmental cat appear. Because let's be honest, that's probably a more accurate representation of my debugging face at 3 AM.

### üåü The Invisible Star

There's a tiny, almost invisible star floating around somewhere on the page. Click it if you can find it! It's basically a test of your clicking precision and/or how much free time you have.

### üíé The Special Word

Look for the glowing "DEVELOPER" text in the hero section. Click it for some behind-the-scenes confessions about my coding journey, including that time I spent 6 hours debugging a typo and had an existential crisis.

### üèÜ Progress Tracking

The easter egg system actually tracks your discoveries and shows a progress bar. Because apparently I turned finding hidden jokes into a completionist game. There's even a celebration when you find them all!

_Pro tip: I may have gotten a bit carried away with the easter egg messages. They're... very much in my voice. You've been warned._ üòÖ

## My Approach

I believe in writing clean, readable code and creating user experiences that feel natural. This portfolio reflects my commitment to continuous learning and my passion for solving problems through code. Every component and interaction has been thoughtfully crafted, not just to look good, but to serve a purpose.

## What's Next

I'm constantly learning and improving. This portfolio will continue to evolve as I grow as a developer, with new projects, skills, and insights being added regularly.

## Connect With Me

Feel free to explore the code, check out my projects, or reach out if you'd like to chat about development, opportunities, or just to say hello!
